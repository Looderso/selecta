# UI Widgets Module Documentation

## Overview

The widgets module is intended to provide reusable base widget classes and utility widgets for the Selecta UI. These widgets serve as building blocks for more complex UI components.

## Current Status

This module is currently a placeholder for future widget development. As the application grows, common widget patterns can be extracted and placed here.

## Potential Widget Types

- **Custom Buttons**: Styled buttons with specialized behavior
- **Custom List/Table Views**: Enhanced list and table widgets
- **Form Components**: Input fields, dropdowns, etc. with validation
- **Notification Widgets**: Toast messages, alerts
- **Loading Indicators**: Spinners, progress bars
- **Card Components**: Container widgets for displaying content in card format

## Dependencies

- Internal: UI themes for styling
- External: PyQt6 for base widget functionality

## Implementation Notes

- Widgets should be designed for reusability across the application
- Maintain consistent styling that works with the theme system
- Provide clear, well-typed interfaces
- Document widget behavior and properties

## Future Development

As the application evolves, common widget patterns from the components module may be refactored into this module to promote reusability and maintainability.

## Usage Guidelines

When implementing new UI features:

1. Check if an appropriate widget already exists in this module
2. If not, consider whether the widget you're creating could be generalized and added here
3. Focus on making widgets self-contained and composable
