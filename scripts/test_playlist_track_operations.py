"""Test playlist track addition and removal operations with comprehensive safety.

This script tests adding and removing tracks from playlists on each platform:
- Creating test playlists
- Searching for tracks
- Adding tracks to playlists
- Removing tracks from playlists
- Verifying track counts

All operations use the safety system to ensure no real playlists are touched.
