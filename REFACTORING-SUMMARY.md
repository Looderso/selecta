# Platform Integration Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the refactoring of the platform integration components in Selecta.

## Key Changes

### 1. PlatformSyncManager Implementation

A comprehensive `PlatformSyncManager` was implemented to centralize and standardize synchronization operations between platforms and the local database:

- Handles track import/export with platform-specific metadata mapping
- Manages playlist synchronization with conflict resolution
- Standardizes the interface for all platform operations
- Adds robust error handling and logging

Location: `/src/selecta/core/platform/sync_manager.py`

### 2. AbstractPlatform Interface Compliance

All platform clients were updated to properly implement the `AbstractPlatform` interface:

- `SpotifyClient`: Enhanced export functionality with standardized URI handling
- `RekordboxClient`: Added support for folder-aware playlist management
- `DiscogsClient`: Added comprehensive support for collection/wantlist as playlist equivalents

### 3. PlaylistDataProvider Standardization

Updated all PlaylistDataProvider implementations to use the new architecture:

- `SpotifyPlaylistDataProvider`: Now uses PlatformSyncManager for import/export
- `RekordboxPlaylistDataProvider`: Updated to use standardized interfaces
- `DiscogsPlaylistDataProvider`: Added import functionality with proper UI integration
- `LocalPlaylistDataProvider`: Completely refactored with centralized platform-specific handling

### 4. Discogs Integration Enhancements

Completed Discogs integration with special handling for its unique features:

- Added support for collection/wantlist as playlist equivalents
- Implemented vinyl-specific metadata mapping
- Added UI components for Discogs operations
