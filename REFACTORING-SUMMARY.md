# Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the refactoring of various components in Selecta.

## GUI Refactoring Plan

### Current Issues

1. **UI Responsiveness**
   - Draggable separators become slow and unresponsive when right components (search/track info) are filled with content
   - Overall UI feels sluggish during data-heavy operations

2. **Cover Image Display**
   - Cover images don't properly clear when selecting tracks without covers
   - Previous cover remains displayed when no cover is available

3. **Playlist Update Issues**
   - Playlists don't automatically refresh when tracks are updated
   - Manual switching between playlists required to see changes

4. **Playlist Loading Problems**
   - Some playlists (e.g., collection) get stuck in perpetual loading state
   - Requires switching to another platform and back to fix

### Refactoring Approach

#### 1. Background Processing

- Move all data-intensive operations to background threads:
  - Data loading/parsing
  - Database operations
  - Network requests
  - Image processing

- Implement a robust worker thread system:
  - Use Qt's `QThreadPool` and `QRunnable` for thread management
  - Add proper cancellation handling for aborted operations
  - Implement thread-safe result delivery mechanism

#### 2. UI Component Optimization

- Optimize heavy UI components:
  - Virtualize large list/table views to render only visible items
  - Implement lazy loading for images and complex content
  - Use Qt's model/view architecture more effectively

- Improve separator/splitter performance:
  - Consider lower frequency updates during resize operations
  - Implement delayed content rendering during active dragging
  - Use simplified placeholder content during resize operations

#### 3. Smart Content Loading

- Implement proper cover image handling:
  - Add null-state checking before displaying covers
  - Clear image display when no cover is available
  - Add fade transitions between cover states

- Optimize content loading:
  - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
  - Use placeholder content during loading operations
  - Add visual loading indicators

#### 4. Reactive UI Updates

- Implement proper signal/slot connections:
  - Create a central event system for data changes
  - Connect all UI components to relevant data change events
  - Ensure playlist views listen for track update events

- Add targeted refresh mechanisms:
  - Implement partial updates instead of full refreshes
  - Use playlist-specific update signals
  - Track dirty state for components needing refresh

#### 5. Debugging Support

- Add performance monitoring:
  - Implement timing for critical operations
  - Log slow operations for further optimization
  - Consider adding an optional debug overlay

- Improve error handling:
  - Add better error reporting for failed operations
  - Implement automatic recovery from common failures
  - Ensure loading states resolve properly even on error

### Implementation Priority

1. Fix cover image display issues (quick win)
2. Implement background thread system for heavy operations
3. Add reactive UI updates for playlist changes
4. Fix playlist loading issues
5. Optimize separator/splitter performance
6. Add performance monitoring and debugging support

## Platform Integration Refactoring

### 1. PlatformSyncManager Implementation

A comprehensive `PlatformSyncManager` was implemented to centralize and standardize synchronization operations between platforms and the local database:

- Handles track import/export with platform-specific metadata mapping
- Manages playlist synchronization with conflict resolution
- Standardizes the interface for all platform operations
- Adds robust error handling and logging

Location: `/src/selecta/core/platform/sync_manager.py`

### 2. AbstractPlatform Interface Compliance

All platform clients were updated to properly implement the `AbstractPlatform` interface:

- `SpotifyClient`: Enhanced export functionality with standardized URI handling
- `RekordboxClient`: Added support for folder-aware playlist management
- `DiscogsClient`: Added comprehensive support for collection/wantlist as playlist equivalents

### 3. PlaylistDataProvider Standardization

Updated all PlaylistDataProvider implementations to use the new architecture:

- `SpotifyPlaylistDataProvider`: Now uses PlatformSyncManager for import/export
- `RekordboxPlaylistDataProvider`: Updated to use standardized interfaces
- `DiscogsPlaylistDataProvider`: Added import functionality with proper UI integration
- `LocalPlaylistDataProvider`: Completely refactored with centralized platform-specific handling

### 4. Discogs Integration Enhancements

Completed Discogs integration with special handling for its unique features:

- Added support for collection/wantlist as playlist equivalents
- Implemented vinyl-specific metadata mapping
- Added UI components for Discogs operations

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Spotify playlist import
- [ ] Spotify playlist export
- [ ] Rekordbox playlist import
- [ ] Rekordbox playlist export
- [ ] Discogs collection import
- [ ] Discogs wantlist import
- [ ] Export local playlist to Discogs collection/wantlist
- [ ] Track linking between platforms

## Future Improvements

1. **Testing & Reliability**
   - Add comprehensive unit tests for PlatformSyncManager
   - Add integration tests for platform client implementations
   - Implement error recovery for network failures during sync operations

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add batch processing for large playlists
   - Optimize database queries in repositories
   - Implement background sync operations

3. **User Experience**
   - Add progress reporting for long-running operations
   - Enhance error messages with actionable information
   - Provide visual indicators for linked tracks

4. **Documentation**
   - Update user documentation with new features
   - Add developer onboarding documentation
   - Create examples for implementing new platforms
